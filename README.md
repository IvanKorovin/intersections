# Intersections
##Intersection of two polygons in Javascript 
" javascript library that take 2 polygons and return a third polygon that represents an intersection of the given 2 polygons. It works for both convex and concave polygon, but probably not as expected for complex polygons. Polygons are javascript arrays of Points. 'Point' is any javascript object that has both x and y numeric properties. The order of points in an array that defines a polygon is very important. The same set of n points can produce n! different polygons. Most all of them will be complex."
